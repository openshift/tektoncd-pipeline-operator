  title: S2I-Python-3 Pipeline Resource based Task
  description: |
    An s2i task to build python 3 based source.
    Source-to-Image (S2I) is a toolkit and workflow for building reproducible container images from source code.
    S2I produces images by injecting source code into a base S2I container image and letting the container prepare that source code for execution.
    The base S2I container images contains the language runtime and build tools needed for building and running the source code.
